			Wikipedia is always among top 10 most visited websites. Yet, most

				<u> extremely biased. </u>
			</a>
			To address this issue, I built an NLP model to detect relative level
			of controversy and source quality of each English Wikipedia entry.

			<b>The Talk page model </b> <br />I leveraged fine-tuned BERT model
			to detect tones of a Talk page. The output is one of 11 emotions
			(anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism,
			sadness, surprise, trust, neutral/no emotion).

			<b>Source citation model </b> <br />
			We can evaluate a source based on its relevance, currency, accuracy,
			authority, and purpose. I decided to focus on currency and authority
			because of technical constraints at the time. <br />
			Currency is how recent the source is. A rule of thumb is the more
			recent, the better, because knowledge gets updated over time. <br />
			Authority is whether the author or where it got published has the
			reputation. Eg: You would want to hear health advice from a Harvard
			medical student more than a fashion influencer.
